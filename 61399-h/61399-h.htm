<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">PHILADELPHIA HOUSES IN COLONIAL TIMES</span></h2>
<p>Philadelphia was the most important city in the colonies
and the home of many leaders of thought and action in the
days which saw the birth of the American nation. We are
fortunate in having preserved for us the few historic
landmarks in Fairmount Park, which have been restored
through the leadership of the Pennsylvania Museum of
Art and cooperative institutions and by the generosity of
Philadelphians. This book contains pictures and sketches
of eight old colonial houses, several of which date back to
the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Of the houses described, Cedar Grove, Belmont, The Cliffs,
Woodford and Mount Pleasant antedate the Revolution, and
are examples of early Georgian and mid-Georgian styles.
The simple stone cottages which stand on the grounds at
Belmont, Woodford and Strawberry antedate in style the
mansion-houses there. Even the oldest portion of Cedar
Grove, 1721, already shows a front of squared masonry, while
the oldest part of Woodford has on the end the glazed headers
which characterize the earliest brick buildings of the colony.
The later houses are generally covered with stucco.</p>
<p>By the middle of the century there were bold classic
doorways, as at Belmont, Woodford (then enlarged) and
Mount Pleasant. Rich ornamented ceilings from about 1760
are found at Belmont; the principal rooms at Woodford and
Mount Pleasant are adorned with elaborate carving in the
Chippendale style. After the Revolution the more slender
proportions of the Adam style were adopted, in the later
part of Cedar Grove and at Lemon Hill, Sweetbrier and
Strawberry. The wings at Strawberry show the severe
classic detail of the Greek Revival.</p>

<h3 id="c2">SWEETBRIER</h3>
<p>The first owner of Sweetbrier was Samuel Breck, who
records in his notes that he built his mansion in 1797,
having &ldquo;out-buildings of every kind suitable for elegance
and comfort. The prospect consists of the river, animated
by its great trade carried on in boats of about thirty tons,
drawn by horses; of a beautiful sloping lawn, terminating
at that river, now nearly four hundred yards wide opposite
the portico; of side-screen woods; of gardens, green-house,
etc.&mdash;Sweetbrier is the name of my villa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The restoration was undertaken in 1918 by the Junior
League of Philadelphia, with the advice of the Museum,
and the house now serves as the headquarters for the
Junior League.</p>
<p>On entering, the visitor will be impressed with the simplicity
of the architecture and the delicacy of the ornament.
Of a later date than that of Mount Pleasant, the style
is more classic, varied by the relief ornament of the
mantels and the number of large graceful windows. The
large reception room contains four beautifully carved Heppelwhite
side chairs, a pair of mahogany card tables and
a sofa of the same style. Wedgwood vases, gilt torch&egrave;res
and a large Oriental rug represent imported objects which
the room might have exhibited in its original state. A rare
acquisition, a complete set of William Birch&rsquo;s views of
Philadelphia, hang upon these walls and on the stair
landing. At the right of the fireplace stands a painted armchair
with needlepoint back and seat, and nearby is a
tripod candlestand. These pieces formed a part of the original
furnishings of Sweetbrier, and have been lent by the descendants
of Samuel Breck. In a vitrine near the west door, a
miniature on ivory shows the youthful Samuel Breck.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h3 id="c3">CEDAR GROVE</h3>
<p>Cedar Grove is an ancestral home of the Morris family.
The house, which stood for over two hundred years near
Harrowgate station in Frankford, in 1927 was removed
stone by stone. It has been re-erected on Lansdowne Drive
near Memorial Hall, with its original contents, through the
generosity of Miss Lydia Thompson Morris. The land at
Frankford was bought in 1714 by Thomas Coates of High
Street, the father of Elizabeth Coates. In 1721 Elizabeth
married Isaac Paschall, and it is from this time that dates
the oldest portion of the house. Isaac Paschall, a son of
Elizabeth, married Patience Mifflin in 1767. The house came
to his daughter Sarah, who married Isaac W. Morris in 1795.</p>
<p>Through the munificent gift of Miss Morris, Cedar Grove
has retained its heirlooms dating from 1720 to 1800.
Within its walls may be seen furniture from the simple
William and Mary type to the elegant examples of Heppelwhite
and Sheraton.</p>
<p>One enters directly into the living room with the informality
of pre-Revolutionary times. The Chippendale sofa,
upholstered in yellow brocade, the pie-crust table and the
six ball-and-claw foot chairs combine easily with the earlier
William and Mary highboy and lowboy.</p>
<p>In the dining room, the majority of pieces illustrate the
formal Heppelwhite style. The kitchen remains in a simple
state, its large fireplace adequately supplied with cranes
and pots.</p>
<p>Passing upstairs one visits the several bedrooms, furnished
mainly in Heppelwhite style. The beds with their fluted
posts and straight chintz hangings illustrate the simplicity
which followed Chippendale&rsquo;s exuberant curves. In the
same style are mahogany chests of drawers with bracket feet.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c4">BELMONT</h3>
<p>Belmont was the product of gradual growth. In the stone
cottage Judge Richard Peters, the most famous owner of the
estate, was born on June 22, 1744. The adjoining brick
structure, ultimately forming a south wing of the mansion
house, comes next in order of time, 1745. The present main
house, of brick and rubble, followed, probably about 1755,
and, somewhat later, the great stair tower. The style of
their ornaments indicates these were finished about 1760,
and we know that by 1762 they stood essentially complete,
surrounded by well-developed gardens and plantations.</p>
<p>William Peters, the father of Richard, had come to
America in 1739, married Mary Breitnall, and acquired the
property by deed of July 21, 1742. It had been from the
beginning of the war in the tenancy of Richard Peters,
to whom it was finally conveyed in 1786, and was occupied
by him until his death in 1828. In 1927 it was restored by
Fritz Pflug, restaurateur, with the advice of the Museum.</p>
<p>It represents the early Georgian style of the middle of the
eighteenth century, a precursor of the rocaille ornament of
the Chippendale period. The massiveness of the carving and
plaster ceiling ornaments harks back to motifs common to
the late seventeenth century of the Louis XIV style.</p>
<p>The contents of the older part of the house are copies of
mid-eighteenth century Philadelphia furniture. In the parlour
opposite the fireplace stands a replica of the sofa owned by
Washington during his residence in Philadelphia. Above it
is to be seen a portrait of William Peters, the builder of
Belmont. The ceiling is considered the earliest ornamental
plaster work in an American house.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c5">STRAWBERRY</h3>
<p>Strawberry&rsquo;s first owner, in 1798, was Judge Lewis, a
notable lawyer and a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly.</p>
<p>The original house was of the then new American style
with certain light touches reminiscent of the Adam period,
the entrance hall having four niches and gouged mouldings.
The wings in the taste of the Greek Revival were added
about 1825 by the second owner Judge Joseph Hemphill, a
close friend of Jefferson and an ardent democrat. Lafayette
was among the many distinguished guests entertained at
Strawberry during the second period of the house.</p>
<p>Strawberry has been restored by the Committee of 1926, a
group of women who were instrumental in building High
Street at the Sesquicentennial Celebration.</p>
<p>The furniture at Strawberry is of the late eighteenth and
first quarter of the nineteenth centuries. In the parlour a
fine Sheraton sofa and four chairs are noteworthy, as is the
piano made in Philadelphia by Charles Albrecht in 1785.
Across the hall, the library is consistently furnished in the
Empire style. A fine writing desk with rounded ends, a
Regency suite of black settee and armchairs with X-shaped
supports and four gilt chairs are noteworthy pieces.</p>
<p>Beyond is the Music Room, its windows and mantel
forming the decorative features of the room. Upstairs are
two late eighteenth century rooms. One shows a fine Heppelwhite
sideboard and a set of Sheraton chairs, the other a
carved four-post bed, &ldquo;Beau-Brummel&rdquo; toilet chest and
Sheraton chairs. Beyond is a small Empire bedroom.</p>
<p>In the opposite wing the Banquet Room is carried out in
the same manner, the star-sprinkled walls, crystal and
bronze chandelier and imperial yellow silk draperies having
the formality of the First Empire.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 id="c6">WOODFORD</h3>
<p>Woodford has long been distinguished for its stately
proportions, tawny yellow brickwork and many-paned
windows, behind a screen of beautiful walnut trees. It has
lately been opened to the public by Daniel T. V. Huntoon,
Trustee of the estate of the late Naomi Wood. Her bequest
of her collection together with an endowment fund, has
been the means of accomplishing this restoration.</p>
<p>The early history of Woodford is not definitely known,
as there were nine changes of ownership from 1693, when the
original grant of land was made by William Penn, to 1800.</p>
<p>On entering the house the visitor finds the hall distinguished
by a panelled wainscot, fluted pilasters and six
doors. To the left is the parlour, one of the handsomest
rooms of the period in America.</p>
<p>Amongst the furniture, which is American throughout,
are a rare Chippendale sofa and wing chair, a fine example
of the transitional style of armchair, a small writing desk
of about 1690, and a Philadelphia tripod tea-table.</p>
<p>The lighting fixtures are rare examples of authentic metalwork,
the brass chandelier having come from England about
1725. A pair of George II gilt bronze wall sconces between
the windows came from Hornby Castle in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Across the hall, the dining room is a counterpart of the
parlour save for the chimneypiece and furniture. On leaving
the dining room, the staircase is evident for the first time, as
it occupies the wing added upon the completion of the house
in 1756. Above the stairs are two large rooms and a smaller
room. Over the parlour is the master&rsquo;s bedroom, now
restored as a sitting room. Some pieces of furniture in this
room go back to 1700. In the bedroom upon the walnut
highboy are old bandboxes covered with stencilled papers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 id="c7">MOUNT PLEASANT</h3>
<p>The mansion built in 1761 by John Macpherson was sold
on March 27, 1779, to Benedict Arnold. Keeping a life
interest himself, he settled it, as his marriage gift, on his
beautiful bride, the heiress Peggy Shippen, daughter of
Edward Shippen. Benedict Arnold never occupied it. Later
his life interest was confiscated and the mansion was sold
in 1781. Edward Shippen ultimately consolidated the entire
ownership in his family by purchase in 1784. Meanwhile
the house had had another distinguished tenant, if not
occupant, in Major General Baron von Steuben. Later it
was sold to General Jonathan Williams, in whose family it
remained until 1853. In 1926 it was restored through the
generosity of the late Charles H. Ludington.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of a Revolutionary house has been created
by finishing the rooms with Chippendale furniture, contemporary
portraits, and small objects of foreign importation.</p>
<p>The entrance is simply furnished with a Georgian mirror
and table. In the large and formal parlour at the right
stands a very handsome secretary bookcase originally made
in the City. Fitting companions to this piece, a beautifully
carved highboy, tripod table and chairs in the Philadelphia
Chippendale style, give the room an air of elegance. On the
stair landing stands a tall clock bearing the name of &ldquo;David
Rittenhouse,&rdquo; the most famous clockmaker in America.</p>
<p>On the second floor, two bedrooms are attractively
furnished with four-post beds and hung, to match the
windows, with appropriate India prints and eighteenth
century Chintz. Pieces by Philadelphia cabinetmakers bear
evidence to the excellent qualities of their workmanship.
Other noteworthy pieces are two fine wing chairs, a block-front
desk and a pair of ladder-back chairs.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c8">THE CLIFFS</h3>
<p>The Cliffs stands above the East River Drive, commanding
a splendid view down the Schuylkill to the south toward
Lemon Hill, and to the north past Mount Pleasant. The
house, a compact structure of stuccoed rubble, was built by
Samuel Rowland Fisher in 1741 and, unlike several other
of the park houses in the Museum group, remained in the
ownership of one family until taken over by the Park
Commission in 1868. It had, however, been leased from time
to time, as a letter dated 1789 bears witness, written by
Sarah Bache to Benjamin Franklin, her father, who was
then in France. It relates that she had just moved to &ldquo;this
small, charming house which the French minister (who is
delivering letter) will describe in detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is considerable panelling of a simple kind throughout
the house, chiefly occurring on the chimney wall of the
rooms, the remaining walls being plastered and wainscoted.
The parlour, opening directly from the outside, is a dignified
room having exposures on two sides and a panelled chimney
wall on the third.</p>
<p>The Cliffs is not usually open to the public. Mr. and Mrs.
Erling H. Pedersen, the occupants, have gathered many
old pieces of American furniture suitable to the house.
Particularly notable is a slant-top walnut desk, a small
Chippendale sofa and a pair of ladder-back side chairs.
Beyond is the dining room, one stair leading down into
the old kitchen with its great fireplace and beamed ceiling,
the other leading up to two pleasant chambers, furnished
with four-post beds and early walnut chests of drawers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h3 id="c9">LEMON HILL</h3>
<p>Lemon Hill was built in 1798 on the site of the Robert
Morris country house called &ldquo;The Hills.&rdquo; Here he had his
famous green houses with the first lemon trees in Philadelphia,
which ultimately gave their name to the estate.</p>
<p>On Morris&rsquo; insolvency it was purchased by Henry Pratt,
an opulent merchant, who built the present house. The oval
drawing room was of the type then popular among the
leaders of the government and society, found also in the
White House in Washington and in the homes of Alexander
Hamilton and General Henry Knox. The drawing room on
the first floor and dining room on the floor below are the
principal rooms of the house, the long windows on the
south side giving a prospect of the river and being balanced
on the opposite wall by a pair of fireplaces. The curved
mahogany doors in these rooms are rich accents of colour
against the blue woodwork and buff walls. In the library
is one of the most delicate and beautiful of the early marble
mantelpieces, with the legend of Leda.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fiske Kimball, who occupy the house, have
furnished it with appropriate pieces of the late eighteenth
century in the Heppelwhite and Sheraton style. In the
drawing room is a handsome suite of white and gold
furniture in the Louis XVI style, including a settee and
twelve armchairs. They were made in Philadelphia about
1800 for Edward Burd. The hangings are of a classic pattern
in blue and silver, and over the mantels are a pair of colourful
landscapes in the manner of Hubert Robert.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
